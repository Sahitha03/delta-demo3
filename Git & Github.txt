What is Git
-----------
Free & Open Source Version Control System

tools that help to track changes in code.

1)track history
2)help to coloborate.

What is GitHub
--------------
Website where we host repositories online.

commit means change

Configuring Git
---------------

git config --global user.name "My Name"

git config --global user.email "alurisaisahitha@gmail.com"

Clone-Cloning a repository 
 ex:git --clone https://github.com/Sahitha03/delta-demo3.git

status-displays the status of the code.

 Various status
 --------------
1)Modified
2)Untracked
3)Unmodified
4)Staged

The files which are created in vs code after cloning are untracked.

1)add-adds new or changed files in your working directory tothe Git staging area.

 commit is of two steps:
 1)add
 2)commit

When we add modified files then it status becomes staged.

2)commit-It is the record of change.
   git commit -m "some message"

3)push - upload local repo content to remote repo
  
     git push origin main

init Command
------------
init-used to create a new git repo

  git init

git remote add origin <-link->

git remote -v (to verify remote)

git branch (to check branch)

git branch -M main (to rename branch)

git push origin main (or) git push -u origin main

git commmit -am "Added a line" //adding and commiting at a time (modified file)

Workflow
-------

GitHub                                     Local Git
------                                     ----------
code->change->commit->pull request       code->changes->add(stage change)->commit-push->pull request


Branch Commands
---------------
git branch (to check branch)

git branch -M main (to rename branch)

git checkout <-branch name -> (to navigate)

git checkout -b <-new branch name-> (to create new branch)

git branch -d <-branch name-> (to delete branch)

Merging Code
------------

git diff <-branch name-> (to compare commits,branches,files & more)

git merge <-branch name-> (to merge branches)

   OR
Create a PR

pull Request
------------
It lets you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub.

Pull Command
------------
git pull origin main

used to fetch and download content from a remote repo and immediately update the local repo to match the content.

Merge Conflicts
---------------
An event that takes place when Git is unable to automatically resolve differences in code between two commits.


Fixing Mistakes
--------------

Case 1:staged changes
      
      git reset <-file name
      git reset

Case 2:committed changes(for one commit)
      
     git reset HEAD~1 (point towardslast head)

Case 3:Committed changes(for many commits)

     git reset<-commit hash->
     git reset --hard <-commit hash->
    
What is Forking
---------------
A fork is a new repository that shares code and visibility settings with the original "upstream" repository.

Fork is a rough copy.
